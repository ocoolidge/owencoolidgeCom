          <p>
            In this digital typography piece, letters are forced into a structured arrangement and slowly devolve into a
            soup of language fragments.
            <br>
            <!--&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe randomized, autonomous nature
            of the letter's behavior is considered together with the computational operations that determine this very behavior.  The structure of the flocks morph between order and
            chaos as word fragments peel off from their original phrases in accorance
            with the value returned by the isDeviant() function.  My consideration towards the poetics of <i>News Simulation</i> was not rooted soley in the aesthetic of
            the letter's behavior, but also in the poetics of the computational algorithms that, in the end, <i>are</i> its behavior.  Within the new Flock() each new Boid() contains probabilityOfDeviance() boolean
            that, if true, randomly alters its velocity.x vector by between +-0.05 radians.  This is all to say that the poetics of this digital typeography piece
            is rooted in its codeâ€”an isDeviant() function is poetic in and of itself.-->
